                    <h1>WHAT IS SEEFOOD?</h1>
                    <p>SEEFOOD is an interactive recipe book which uses a web application that will scan AR and QR codes to
                        initialize a delightful and immersive experience for the customer. Users will be able to see their
                        ingredients in a 3D form using AR to help them understand what the product looks like in its full
                        form before they build their grocery list or buy the ingredients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Users can also access our brand recommendations for each ingredient if he or she clicks on the 3d
                     model.  The people at SEEFOOD wants our users to have delightful experience but also create an experience
                    that is globally accessible to everyone.</p>

                    <h2>Customer Quotes</h2>
                    <p> “When I am building my grocery list to buy the ingredients in a recipe book I do not feel confident
                    to buy some of the products. If there was some way to visualize the product and its density I would
                    feel better about creating a dish with unfamiliar ingredients. For example when I was making a
                    korean recipe the ingredients asked for products I have never purchased before. Instead of searching
                    and looking through images it would be great to easily visualize it so I can find it at the store.”</p>
